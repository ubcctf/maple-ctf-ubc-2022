LKke OFB, counter mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher. 
IV generates the next keystream block by encrypting successive values of a "counter". ITJe counter can be any function which produces a sequence which is guaranteed not to 
rGpeat for a long time, although an actual increment-by-one counter is the simplest 
aLd most popular. The usage of a simple deterministic input function used to be contro5e7sialx 
cPitics argued that "deliberately exposing a cryptosystem to a known systematic input IrGpresents an unnecessary risk."[30] However, today CTR mode is widely accepted and an: OpPoblems are considered a weakness of the underlying block cipher, which is expected t, ObG secure regardless of systemic bias in its input.[31] Along with CBC, CTR mode is on& OoD two block cipher modes recommended by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier.[32]
CvR mode was introduced by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1979.[31]
CvR mode has similar characteristics to OFB, but also allows a random access property IdWring decryption. CTR mode is well suited to operate on a multi-processor machine whe1ee
