The big array in the binary is actually a 3-dimensional maze. The allowed character set of `wasdqe` are actually moves. Each move will add/subtract one to the players x/y/z coordinates. The program defines a starting location at (7,0,7) and a ending location at (7,1,0). The correct password is the sequence of moves for the shortest path from the starting location to the ending location. The program will then take the password and hash it. It then uses that hash as an AES key to decrypt the flag. If you got the password right then the flag will appear.
