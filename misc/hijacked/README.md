# Hijacked

A fairly-straightforward Wireshark parsing challenge. You're given a Wireshark log containing a number of coordinate pairs. Putting these together in order in the GPX file format (hinted at in the Wireshark log) gives you a `.gpx` file, which can be opened in the map viewer of your choice.

## Description

Your r/c car has gone haywire, and is driving all over West Vancouver! What's going on?

Make sure to check your capitals.

## Hint

I remember hearing that Wireshark can output JSON. Wouldn't that be convenient?

## Flag

See solve/flag.txt.
