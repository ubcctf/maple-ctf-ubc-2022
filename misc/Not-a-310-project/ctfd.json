"description": "You've come across the name Richarde Gellanse just now, and you to think you know him from somewhere. Maybe you took a course with him this term? Maybe you can figure out his lecture schedule from his social media? It seems like Richarde wasn't the best at keeping a small digital footprint. \n Please submit a flag with the format Maple{###_###_###...###}, where each ### represents the numerical portion of a course code, and each course appears in the order that Richarde would have attended lectures from a normal Monday to a normal Tuesday in 2021W1 term (e.g. 2021 Dec 6 - 2021 Dec 7). For example, if Richarde had lectures for POLI 100, ENGL 110, and MATH 101 on Monday in that order, and EOSC 110, PYSC 101 on Tuesday, please submit 'Maple{100_110_101_110_101}'. \n Note: In the process of solving this challenge, you may encounter some sketchy looking sites. If you do, these have NOTHING to do with the challenge. Everything that's part of the challenge is on well-known, well-used websites. If you don't know the website, it's probably not relevant. \n HINT: Richarde does have labs.",
