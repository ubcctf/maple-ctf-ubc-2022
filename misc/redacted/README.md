# Redacted

A simple three-part forensics challenge.

- Part 1: A PDF containing a link to Part 2, that's covered by a removable black box
- Part 2: A tarball containing a Git project where a certain file was removed in a previous commit
- Part 3: A pixelated PNG of the flag that can be resampled enough to make out the flag

## Description

Your lawyer just accidentally sent you something you don't think you were supposed to get. Good thing it's safely redacted...

## Hint

Good thing you can't copy-paste images!

## Flag

See solve/flag.txt.
